## App Introduction

Getting a job is no easy task, especially with tight competition and increased challenges during the application and
recruitment process.

- It takes **21 to 80 job applications** to get one job offer, on average.
- 61.7% of job seekers get at least one interview by sending between **1-10 job applications**.
- 51% of job seekers receive a job offer after having **3 job interviews**.

The jobs apply for are scattered all over the place (Indeed, LinkedIn, email, personal meetings, etc),
making it hard to remember where we've applied and where we stand with each opportunity.

This is a tool to help user track and organize job search that offers one place to keep all of those jobs and all the
information related to them.
